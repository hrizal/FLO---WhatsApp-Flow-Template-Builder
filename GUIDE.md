# FLO - WhatsApp Flow Designer User Guide

Welcome to **FLO**, the visual designer for WhatsApp Flows. This tool helps you create, edit, and generate valid JSON configuration for WhatsApp Flows without writing code manually.

## 1. Getting Started

### The Interface
The FLO interface is divided into two main areas:
- **Left Column (Preview)**: A real-time preview of how your flow will look on a mobile device. You can interact with some components here.
- **Right Column (Editor)**: The control center where you add components and edit their properties.

### Starting a New Flow
*   To start fresh, click the **"New Flow"** button in the top-right corner.
*   *Note:* This will reset all current screens and components.

## 2. Managing Screens
Your Flow can have multiple screens (e.g., a "Sign Up" screen, then a "Success" screen).
- **Add Screen**: Click **"+ Add Screen"** in the sidebar (under the phone preview).
- **Navigate**: Click on a screen name in the list to switch the editor and preview to that screen.
- **Reorder/Delete**: Use the arrows and trash icon next to each screen name to manage them.
- *Free Plan Limit*: Unpaid users are limited to 2 screens.

## 3. Adding & Editing Components

### Adding Components
1. Go to the **Designer** tab in the right column.
2. Look at the **Components** list (Top half).
3. Click on any component button (e.g., `TextHeading`, `TextInput`, `Footer`) to add it to the active screen.
4. The component will appear in the Phone Preview immediately.

### Editing Components
1. **Select**: Click on the component inside the **Phone Preview** OR in the **Component List** (top right).
2. **Edit**: The **Properties Panel** (bottom right) will update to show the settings for that component.
    - **Label/Text**: Change the visible text.
    - **ID/Name**: Set the variable name for form submissions.
    - **Required**: Mark inputs as mandatory.
3. **Reorder**: Use the **Up/Down** arrows in the component list to change their position.
4. **Delete**: Click the **Trash** icon next to a component to remove it.

## 4. Understanding the Tabs

The Layout Editor has 4 main tabs at the bottom. Here is what they do:

### 1. Designer (The Main Tab)
This is where you build. It contains:
- **Palette**: Buttons to add new components.
- **Structure**: A list of current components on the screen.
- **Properties**: Fields to generic settings like Text, Labels, IDs, and visibility.

### 2. Screen Data
This tab manages the **dynamic data** passed to the screen.
- Use this to define variables (e.g., product names, prices) that come from your backend.
- **Editor**: You can edit the JSON object that represents the default/example data.
- **Usage**: In the Designer properties, you can reference this data using `${data.variable_name}`.

### 3. Flow Properties
Global settings for the entire Flow.
- **Flow Version**: e.g., "7.3".
- **Data API Version**: e.g., "3.0".
- **Routing Model**: Advanced logic defining which screen comes next.

### 4. Full JSON (The Export)
This is your final output.
- **View**: See the complete, valid JSON code generated by your visual design.
- **Copy**: Click the **Copy** button to copy the code.
- **Use**: Paste this code into the **Meta WhatsApp Manager** or your flow configuration file.
- **Import**: You can also Paste an existing JSON here and click "Import" to load it into the designer.

## 5. Tips
- **Dynamic Data**: To make a text dynamic, type `${data.cust_name}` in a Label field. Then define `cust_name` in the **Screen Data** tab.
- **Preview**: The phone frame is interactive! You can type in inputs and click buttons to test the feel of the UI.
